# TODO

The backlog, in priority order. One task = one branch = one PR. When a task is
merged, move its line to `DONE.md` with the date. Re-plan freely.

## Standing constraints

- `long_capture` stays green (release-blocking eval). Any prompt or schema
  change that sends it red does not merge.
- Don't re-attempt tool-schema minimization on gemma-4-12b — every stripped
  pydantic key collapsed `undo_and_replace` (full record: DONE.md 2026-07-21).
  Gate on that scenario if the brain model ever changes.

## Next

- [ ] **Glitch difficulty** (PCC #332): a tier where the LLM picks its own
      moves instead of Stockfish. Design note first — it amends BRIEF's
      "Stockfish is the move source" stance; the coordinator still owns the
      reply beat and validates against legal moves, with a deterministic
      fallback for an invalid pick, and the reply becomes a model call
      (latency + GPU serialization to think through).
- [ ] **Claim-draw button** (#220 follow-up): `/api/game/claim-draw` through
      the registry (same gate as resign) and the frontend button. The
      `_CONFIRM_QUESTIONS` entry landed with #255. Until then claims are
      unreachable in direct mode.
- [ ] **Re-vendor the voice module downstream** (#232 follow-up): PCC's and
      conductor's `MicButton.tsx` copies predate the #232 wedge fix and the
      #242 inline icons. Their host api clients also need the
      transport-to-null guard (app code the vendored file can't carry).

## Evals / observability

- [ ] Re-run `play_as_black` alone (20 samples, idle GPU, then again placed
      after the long-transcript block) — the 2026-07-26 order-confound arm
      wasn't clean; compare the report lines.
- [ ] Narrator wordiness cap: probably drop. The runaway is already bounded
      by `max_tokens`; the token study showed legit and runaway narrations
      overlap almost entirely, so any cap either misses the tail or clips
      real commentary.

## Someday / blocked

- [ ] Merge `set_verbosity`/`set_voice_output` into one `set_option` — only
      if token pressure ever shows; decide with evals.
- [ ] GBNF grammar-constrained decoding — only if tool-call reliability
      degrades; the live spike showed native tool calls work.
- [ ] Branch protection + native auto-merge — needs a public repo or Pro.
- [ ] Physical board (Chessnut Move) — blocked on hardware. Verify motorized
      actuation is programmatically controllable before any design work;
      until then `control_physical_board` stays a tool seam only.

## Walkthrough leftovers (2026-09-04)

Record: `docs/qa-walkthrough-2026-09-04.md`. Small items, unprioritized:

- [ ] Desktop stacked column: too much dead space — proposed answer: a
      two-column layout on wide screens (board left, agent column right);
      decided 2026-09-04 to take separately from the bubble clamp
- [ ] Not exercised: 40+ move game late-tool reliability; exported PGN in an
      external viewer; Android Chrome hands-free
