// canonical voice module (chess) — other apps vendor verbatim copies; see agent-standard/voice.md
// Voice out: fetch spoken audio for a piece of agent commentary and play it.
// Best-effort by design — if voice is unavailable (503/502) or autoplay is
// blocked, the commentary is still on screen, so failures are silent.
//
// Mobile autoplay: iOS Safari and Android Chrome refuse play() outside a user
// gesture, and the agent reply lands seconds after the tap that requested it.
// The escape hatch is per-element: an <audio> element that has once played
// inside a gesture may be reused programmatically forever after. So all
// playback goes through ONE shared element, and unlockAudio() — called
// synchronously from the gesture handlers — primes it with a silent clip.

/**
 * Client deadline for one /api/voice/speak request, in milliseconds.
 *
 * A request the backend or proxy accepts but never settles is the one failure
 * the catch below cannot see — nothing rejects, so the promise stays pending
 * forever, currentPlayback never settles and the hands-free loop awaiting
 * audioIdle() never reopens the mic. So the fetch carries its own deadline.
 *
 * The value sits between the two timeouts that bracket it: comfortably ABOVE
 * the backend's own speech timeout (60s read + 10s connect), so a slow but
 * living upstream always wins the race and reports its own 502 rather than
 * being cut off by the client, and far BELOW the ~300s proxy ceiling, so the
 * give-up is always this deadline rather than a socket dying under us.
