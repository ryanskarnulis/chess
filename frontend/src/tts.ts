// Voice out: fetch spoken audio for a piece of agent commentary and play it.
// Best-effort by design — if voice is unavailable (503/502) or autoplay is
// blocked, the commentary is still on screen, so failures are silent.
//
// Mobile autoplay: iOS Safari and Android Chrome refuse play() outside a user
// gesture, and the agent reply lands seconds after the tap that requested it.
// The escape hatch is per-element: an <audio> element that has once played
// inside a gesture may be reused programmatically forever after. So all
// playback goes through ONE shared element, and unlockAudio() — called
// synchronously from the gesture handlers — primes it with a silent clip.

// Four samples of 8 kHz 8-bit silence: the shortest well-formed WAV.
